## Introduction

This is a reference manual for Scriggo templates.

The Scriggo templates specification is based on the Go language specification, see <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">golang.org/spec</a>. The Go specification applies, apart from what written in this specification.

## Template source code representation

Template source code between _{%_ and _%}_, _{%%_ and _%%}_ and _{{_ and _}}_ is Unicode text encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>.

Implementation restriction: A template tool, as an editor or interpreter, may require all the template file content to be encoded in UTF-8.

## Lexical elements

### Comments

Line comments and general comments can only appear between _{%_ and _%}_ and between _{%%_ and _%%}_. In addition there is a third form:

3. Template comments start with the character sequence _{#_ and stop with the first subsequent not paired character sequence _#}_. Template comments cannot appear between _{%_ and _%}_, _{%%_ and _%%}_ and between _{{_ and _}}_.

```
{# this is a template comment #}

{# this {# is also a #} comment #}
```

## Types

### Format types

A format type represents a sets of string values that can have a special treatment when used with `show` statement. The `string` type is a format type.

```
string    The string type. The strings in this set are not escaped in a Text context.
html      The set of all strings that are not escaped in a HTML context.
css       The set of all strings that are not escaped in a CSS context.
js        The set of all strings that are not escaped in a JS context.
json      The set of all strings that are not escaped in a JSON context.
markdown  The set of all strings that are not escaped in a Markdown context.
```

### Macro types

There is the new _macro type_.

```
TypeLit = ArrayType | StructType | PointerType | FunctionType | InterfaceType |
          SliceType | MapType | ChannelType | MacroType .
```

_Macro types_ are alias for function types with a single return parameter having a predefined format type (_string_, _html_, _css_, _js_, _json_, _markdown_).

Aliases of format types cannot be used as the return type in a type macro literal.

```
macro() markdown           // alias for func() markdown
macro(int, bool) string    // alias for func(int, bool) string

type foo = string

macro() foo              // not valid, foo is an alias of the string type  
macro([]int) int         // not valid, int is not a format type
macro([]int)             // not valid, has no return parameters
macro() (string, css)    // not valid, has too many return parameters
```

## Declarations

There are no function and method declarations in Scriggo templates.

```
Declaration = ConstDecl | TypeDecl | VarDecl .
```

A constant, type and variable declaration can also be written between _{%_ and _%}_.

```
{% var n = 5 %}

{%
    const (
        n = 5
        m = 7
    )
%}

{% type T struct{ s string } %}
```

In addition there are macro declarations. A macro declaration binds an identifier to a macro.

At part of the different declaration syntax, macros are functions. A macro declaration can only be written using _{%_ and _%}_.

```
MacroDecl   =
    "{%" "macro" MacroName [ Parameters ] [ MacroResult ] "%}"
    Content
    "{%" "end" [ "macro" ] "%}" .
MacroName   = identifier .
MacroResult = "string" | "html" | "css" | "js" | "json" | "markdown" .
```

If a macro declaration does not have a result type, it is inferred from the context of the declaration.

```
Template format   Macro result type

Text              string
HTML              html
CSS               css
JS                js
JSON              json
Markdown          markdown
```

Macro declarations are only allowed in the previous template contexts. 

```
{% macro Title %}A beautiful title{% end %}

{% macro Image(src string, with, height int) html %}
  <a href="{{ src }}" with="{{ width }}" height="{{ height }}">
{% end macro %}
```

Endless macros are macros whose content extends to the end of the file. An endless macro declaration does not have the `macro` keyword,
does not have parameters and have an implicit return value. The name of an endless macro is an exported identifier.

```
EndlessMacroDecl = "{%" EndlessMacroName "%}" Content EOF .
EndlessMacroName = exported_identifier .
```

```
{ extends "layout.html" %}
{% Article %}

This is the article content,

{% a := 5 %} {# a is defined in the scope of the body of the Article macro #}

and more article content.
```

### Predeclared identifiers

The predeclared type identifiers _html_, _css_, _js_, _json_ and _markdown_ that with the type _string_ are called format types:

```
Format types:
    string html css js json markdown
```

The format types are the only types that can be used as macro result type. 

## Expressions

### Primary expressions

The _default expression_ is added to primary expressions.


```
PrimaryExpr =
	Operand |
	Conversion |
	MethodExpr |
	PrimaryExpr Selector |
	PrimaryExpr Index |
	PrimaryExpr Slice |
	PrimaryExpr TypeAssertion |
	PrimaryExpr Arguments |
	Default .

Default = ( identifier | identifier Arguments | Render ) "default" Expression .
```

### Default expression

The left expression `x` of the _default expression_

```
x default e
```

is _resolved_ if one of the following conditions applies:

* `x` is a predeclared identifier of a variable, constant or function
* `x` is a render expression and the file to render exists
* `x` is a call expression `M(a1, a2, â€¦ an)` with `M` an identifier representing a macro declared in the scope of a file that extends the file of the default expression

If the left expression `x` is resolved, `x default e` is replaced with `x` otherwise it is replaced with `e`.

If it is replaced based on its left expression, it must still be valid in its context if it were replaced based on its right expression.

If it is replaced based on its right expression and `x` is a function call, its arguments must be assignable to the empty interface type and if the last argument is followed by `...`, the type of the last argument must be assignable to a slice type `[]T`.


A default expression may only be used in the following cases:

1. Variable declaration as in `var a = x default e`.
2. Short variable declaration as in `a := x default e`.
3. Typed constant declaration as in `const c = x default e`.
4. Assignment as in `v = x default e`.
5. Show statement as  in `show x default e`.

In a declaration, the type of the declared variable or constant is the type it would have if the default expression were replaced with its right expression `e` only. In a constant declaration without a type and with `e` untyped, the declared constant is untyped with the same kind of `e`, and  also `x` must be untyped with the same kind of `e`.

In a declaration or assignment, if the right expression `x` of the default expression is a call or render expression, the type of the right expression `e` must be a format type.

For example:

``` 
var filters []Filter = filters default nil
```

```
{{ Head() default "" }}
```

```
{% show Head() default this using %} ... {% end %}
```

```
{{ render "specials.html" default "no specials" }}
```

### Contains operators

Scriggo templates have <code>contains</code> and <code>not contains</code> operators. The following rules applies:

* For a value `v` of type `[]T` or `[n]T` and a value `x`, the expression `v contains x` yield an untyped boolean; `true` if an element of `v` is equals to `x`. `x` must be assignable to `T` and comparable to the values of `T`.

* For a map `v` with key values of type `T` and a value `x` of type `T`, the expression `v contains x` yield an untyped boolean; `true` if `v` has `x` as key.

* For string values `v` and `x`, the expression `v contains x` yield an untyped boolean; `true` if `x` is within `v`.

* For a string value `v` and a value `x` of type `rune`, the expression `v contains x` yield an untyped boolean; `true` if the Unicode code point `x` is within `v`.

* For a value `v` of type `[]byte` and a value `x` of type `rune`, the expression `v contains x` yield an untyped boolean; `true` if the Unicode code point `x` is within `v`.

If `!(v contains y)` is a valid expression evaluated to the value `b`, also `v not contains y` is a valid expression and it is evaluated to the value `!b`. 

### Operators

The operators are extended with the logical operators `and`, `or` and `not`.

```
binary_op  = "||" | "&&" | rel_op | add_op | mul_op | "and" | "or" .
unary_op   = "+" | "-" | "!" | "^" | "*" | "&" | "<-" | "not" .
```

#### Operator precedence

```
Precedence    Operator
    5             *  /  %  <<  >>  &  &^
    4             +  -  |  ^
    3             ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=  contains  not contains
    2             &&  and
    1             ||  or
```

### The logical zero value

A value `x` of type `T` is _logically zero_ if `x` is the zero value of `T`. The following exceptions applies:
* if `x` is an empty slice or an empty channel, `x` is logically zero,
* if `x` is a non nil interface and `z` is its dynamic value, `x` is logically zero if `z` is logically zero.

### Extended logical operators

Extended logical operators applies to any value and yield an untyped boolean value or an untyped boolean constant if both the operands are constants. The right operand is evaluated conditionally.

```
and   conditional AND   p and q  is  "if p is logically zero then false else q is logically zero" 
or    conditional OR    p or q   is  "if p is logically zero then q is not logically zero else false"
not   NOT               not p    is  "if p is logically zero"
```

### Conversions

A value `x` with type `html`, `css`, `js`, `json` or `markdown` cannot be converted to any other type. The following exception apply:

* if `x` has type `markdown`, `x` can be converted to the `html` type. The conversion transforms the string according to Markdown but the transformation is implementation-dependent. If `x` is constant, the transformation is done at compile-time.  

```
const c1 css = "red"
var c2 js = "var a = 1;"
var c3 markdown = "# title"
const c4 = `{"a":1}`

css(c1)     // a css value can be converted to css
html(c2)    // invalid; a js value cannot be converted html
html(c3)    // a markdown value can be converted to html
json(c4)    // a untyped constant value can be converted to json
```

## Statements

### Go statement

Implementation restriction: an implementation of Scriggo templates can disallow the "go" statement. When disallowed
a compile-time error occurs if used.

### If statement

The expression of the "if" statement is not limited to boolean types but can have any type.
If the expression does not evaluate to a logically zero value, the "if" branch is executed, otherwise, if present,
the "else" branch is executed.  

### For statement

The "for" statement is extended with a fourth form

```
ForStmt  = "for" [ Condition | ForClause | RangeClause | InClause ] Block .
InClause = Identifier "in" Expression .
```

A "for" statement with a "in" clause is the same of a "for" statement with a "range" clause with the first identifier only and the short assignment.

```
for i in s { }

// is the same of

for i := range s { } 
```

### Show statement

The _show_ statement formats the expressions, according to the expression type and the context. If _show_ is used in the body
of a macro the formatted values are appended to the macro response value, otherwise the formatted values are printed to the template output.

```
ShowStmt = "show" { Expression "," } .
```

The _show_ statement cannot be used in a function body.

### Raw statement

In a _raw_ statement the content is rendered as is, the tokens _{%_, _%}_, _{%%_, _%%}_, _{{_, _}}_, _{#_ and _#}_ have no special meaning. 

```
RawStmt = "{%" "raw" [ Marker ] [ Tag ] "%}" Content "{%" "end" [ "raw" [ Marker ] ] "%}" .
Marker  = identifier .
```

For example

```
{% raw %}
   {% if discount %}
     promotion
   {% end if %}
{% end %}
```

is rendered as

```
   {% if discount %}
     promotion
   {% end if %}
```

A raw statement ends at the first `{% end %}` or `{% end raw %}` statement.

The raw statement can have an identifier, called "marker", after the `raw` keyword. In this case the
raw statement ends at the first `{% end raw marker %}` statement and not with `{% end %}` or `{% end raw %}`.  

For example

```
{% raw code %}
   {% if discount %}
     promotion
   {% end %}
{% end raw code %}
```

is rendered as

```
   {% if discount %}
     promotion
   {% end %}
```

Raw statements with different markers can be nested, for example this code

```
{% raw doc %}
   Use a raw statement to render unparsed text as
   {% raw cycle %}
     {% for item in items %} {{ item }} {% end %}
   {% end raw cycle %}
{% end raw doc %}
```

is rendered as

```
   Use a raw statement to render unparsed text as
   {% raw cycle %}
     {% for item in items %} {{ item }} {% end %}
   {% end raw cycle %}
```

A raw statement with a tag is written as

```
{% raw `lang:"javascript"` %}
  var a = 5;
  console.log(a);
{% end %}
```

Markers and tags can be used together

```
{% raw code `lang:"javascript"` %}
  var a = 5;
  console.log(a);
{% end raw code %}
```

## Template files

A template file is a name-less package. Template files in the same directory are different name-less packages.

A template file imported with an "import" statement is a name-less package and can only contain "import" statements and declarations.
A template file with an "extends" statement is a name-less package and can only contain, after the "extends" statements, "import" statements and
declarations.

## Packages

Imported template files and template files with the "extends" statement are packages without a "package" clause and without name.

They contain only "import" statements and variable, constant, type and macro declarations between _{%_ and _%}_ or _{%%_ and _%%}_. Outside these markers, is allowed only bytes [TODO].

## Import-for declarations

The "import" statement has a new "import-for" form.

```
ImportDecl = "import" ( ImportSpec | "(" { ImportSpec ";" } ")" ) .
ImportSpec = [ [ "." | PackageName ] ImportPath | ImportPath "for" { Identifier "," } ] .
```

In the "import-for" form, each identifier is an exported identifier of the package within the importing source file.

```
// Import the Banners and Menus names.
import "imp/components.html" for Banners, Menus

// Import the Index and HasPrefix names.
import "strings" for Index, HasPrefix
 ```
The <code>ImportPath</code> is first interpreted as a template file path. If a template file with this path does not
exist, it is interpreted as a package path.

### Package `"unsafe"`

There is not the "unsafe" package of the Go language in Scriggo templates.
