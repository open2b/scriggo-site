# What is Scriggo

Scriggo is a fast, modern and secure Go template engine and embeddable Go runtime.

It is also a modern and safe template engine that allows to use the Go language also inside templates.  
 
Scriggo can be easily included in any application and does not require Go installed on the client or server because
Scriggo implements the Go programming language with its own compiler and virtual machine written from scratch.

Scriggo is written in pure Go, so it can run on servers, desktops, mobile devises and also on serverless platforms
like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a>,
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> and
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a>.

It's fast. Executes code as fast as mainstream languages like Ruby, Python and Lua.
